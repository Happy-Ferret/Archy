* ORGANIZATION OF THE SOURCE CODE

  Here's the source tree and its directories, with a description of
  each:

  / (root directory)

    The root directory contains most of the source code for Archy, as
    well as some extra files that Archy needs.

  /commands

    This directory contains source code for Archy's built-in commands.

  /commands/aspell

    This directory contains code needed by Archy's spell checker; it
    currently contains a number of files specific to the Windows
    version of Archy, including an entire GNU Aspell dictionary.
    Hopefully some of this will be moved out of the source tree at
    some point.

  /commands/tutorial

    This directory contains all code implementing Archy's tutorials,
    and also currently contains a number of large Ogg Vorbis files
    containing the audio for the tutorials.  These large files may be
    moved out of the source tree at some point.

  /fonts

    This directory contains the default TrueType fonts that Archy
    uses.

  /icons

    This directory contains images used for the Archy application icon
    on many platforms.  See the README.txt file in this directory for
    more information.

  /keycaps

    This directory contains pictures of keys used by Archy's default
    initial document.

  /sdl-patches

    This directory contains various patches written for the Simple
    DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to allow Archy to work properly on
    some platforms.  See the README.txt file in this directory for
    more information.

  /utest

    This directory contains code of unit tests.
    See the README.txt file in this directory for more information.
    See below how to run unit tests.

  /windows_installer_files

    This directory contains files needed for creating a
    self-installing executable for Archy on the Windows platform.  See
    the README.txt file in this directory for more information.

* REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILING AND RUNNING ARCHY

  To compile and run Archy, you'll need the following:

    * REQUIRED - Python version 2.3 or above (http://www.python.org).

    * REQUIRED - Pygame version 1.6 or above (http://www.pygame.org).

      Note that in order to run Pygame, you may need a number of
      prerequisites, depending on your specific platform.  Windows
      users can just download the executable installer, but other
      platforms (such as Linux) will need to make sure they have a
      number of prerequisites, such as SDL.  Although Archy doesn't
      currently use all of Pygame's optional dependencies, this may
      change in the near future, so you're better off installing all
      of them.

      If you want to be absolutely frugal, however, the Pygame
      components with optional dependencies which Archy does not
      currently use are:

        * The pygame.surfarray module.  This means that you don't need
          Python's Numeric package.

	 * The pygame.movie module.  This means that you don't need
          the smpeg library.

    * REQUIRED (Windows) - Archy's custom SDL library

      This is a custom version of the Simple Directmedia Layer,
      patched with some of the patches from the 'sdl_patches'
      directory of the source tree, which allows Archy to work
      properly on Windows platforms.  The custom SDL.dll is contained
      in the root directory of the Archy distribution; just copy it
      into the pygame folder (often found in a directory such as
      C:\Python23\lib\site-packages\pygame).

    * REQUIRED (Windows) - Mark Hammond's Python for Windows
      Extensions (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/).

    * OPTIONAL (Windows, Linux) - Psyco (http://psyco.sourceforge.net/)

      This library currently only works with platforms running on
      Intel x86 processors; if Archy detects its presence, it will use
      Psyco to accelerate a number of its processor-intensive
      functions, allowing it to run a good deal faster.

    * OPTIONAL (non-Windows) - wxPython (http://www.wxpython.org/)

      Non-Windows platforms utilize wxPython to access the clipboard.
      If this library isn't present on a non-Windows system, Archy's
      COPY IN and COPY OUT commands won't work.

    * OPTIONAL - GNU aspell (http://aspell.sourceforge.net/)

      Currently, the source tree includes the Windows version of this
      software (Windows users don't need to install it--Archy finds it
      automatically), and the source code doesn't actually support a
      non-Windows version yet.  This will be changed in the near
      future.  In any case, if the aspell library isn't found, Archy's
      spellchecking features will not work.

* COMPILING AND RUNNING ARCHY

  To run Archy, execute the script 'archy.py' located in the root
  directory of the Archy source tree.
  Archy accepts following command-line options:

    -d, --developer-mode - disables web-based bug reporting,
      enables certain disabled by default commands such as
      SIMULATE BUGGY COMMAND and SIMULATE CRASH.

  Execute 'utest.py' without parameters to run all Archy unit tests:

      python utest.py

  To run a specific Archy unit test modules specify names of the modules
  as parameter utest.py parameters separated by spaces.
  For example:

      python utest.py utest.commands.quitTest utest.audioTest

  * WINDOWS NOTES

    None.  Assuming you've installed all the required dependencies,
    Archy should run fine on your system "out of the box".

  * LINUX NOTES

    The Linux version of Archy is still in a somewhat rough and
    experimental state, and as such users running Archy on Linux may
    need to do some extra work.

    In order to properly access the state of the caps lock key, Archy
    currently needs to use the 'xmodmap' utility.  See the file
    'linux_specific.py' for more information on how this is done; you
    may need to modify this file slightly to work on your system.
    Before using Archy for the first time, you may want to execute the
    following command from a shell prompt:

      'xmodmap -pke > original_keybindings.txt'

    If Archy ever crashes or somehow leaves your keyboard in a state
    in which the caps lock key doesn't work, you can fix things by
    executing the following from a shell prompt:

      'xmodmap original_keybindings.txt'

  * MAC OS X NOTES
