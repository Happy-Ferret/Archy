# This is the key.py function which handles individual keystrokes by the user and implements the state machine used to identify commands and other quasimodes in Archy.

# The keyboard module now (9/15/2004) relies on "keybindings" rather than a state machine.

# Advantages of this method:

# * It makes the code easier to read and understand, since
# the keybindings use Jef's keypress notation, the code is much closer
# to "plain english"; previously, the key.py file used a state machine
# with a lot of if-then statements which made it potentially difficult
# to figure out what was going on.  It also made it difficult for one
# state to simply "add on to" another state's behavior (e.g.,
# UppercaseTextEntry 'builds on' LowercaseTextEntry), which resulted in
# duplicate code.

# * In the state-based model, there was no way to inherit behavior from 
# another state, so certain states had to duplicate code from other 
# states; when said code was not duplicated, bugs occurred. As such, the 
# switch to keybindings has removed a number of bugs in the key module.

# * It does away with extraneous states; for instance, the old 
# UppercaseTextEntry state was just a "stepping stone" to the Leap states 
# and had no other functionality than to duplicate the 
# behavior of the LowercaseText state.

# * It makes the code easier to modify; whenever we want to add/change
# a keybinding (for instance, see Jef's discussion on trying out the Alt
# key as a 'shift' type key for the command quasimode), we can just add
# or change a keybinding in "plain english" (through the use of Jef's
# keypress notation) instead of dealing with if-then statements.

# * It will make it easier to define different keybinding
# "configuration files" for different keyboards--for instance, the
# standard keyboard vs. the LEAP keyboard.  If we wanted to, we could
# even define other configuration files for specific layouts of
# keyboards, although this could complicate things for the end-user.

# Disadvantages of this method:

# * The keyboard module isn't a state machine anymore, which in some
# ways could make things harder to debug if something goes wrong; you
# can't just look at one function/class method and know for a fact that
# it represents the exact state the keyboard module is in.

# * There's a certain amount of infrastructure that had to be added to
# support the parsing of strings like "left shift\ space\ space/" and
# the recording of keystrokes, which adds to the complexity of the code
# (although, in tradeoff, it reduces the complexity of the Quasimodes
# that actually assign the keybindings).

# A Note on Defining the bindings for a KeyBindings class and KeyboardState classes
# Han Kim Oct 7 2004

# The addKeyBindings must be executed for each KeyboardState object when
# it is created for a keystroke sequence to be associated with a function call. 

# It is important to remember that in Python even the 
# __init__(self) methods are virtual methods. So the base class's __init__
# does not automatically get called as in the case of C++ constructors.

# Here is an error I had made :

# LeapBase is the base class of LeapForward and LeapBackward. I had put a call to 
# addKeyBindings("backspace\\", self.delete) in LeapBase.createKeybindings(), expecting
# the LeapForward and LeapBackward to somehow call the LeapBase.createKeybindings() 
# when either LeapForward.createKeybindings() or LeapBackward.createKeyBindings()
# are called. However, the design as of Oct 7 2004 requires that each object define
# ALL of its keybindings in its createKeybindings() method.

# It may be worth a discussion whether the KeyboardState.__init__() function should
# be modified so that the .createKeybindings() of the parents should also be called.
# That way, base class keybindings can be truly inherited.

# Addendum: The LeapForward and LeapBackward classes now manually call their parent class' createKeybindings() method.

# A note on shift keys and CAPS lock problems:

# Han Kim Oct 18 2004
# Updated by Atul Varma - Nov 12 2004

# Archy is now "immune" to the modality of the Caps Lock key.   This was achieved in the following way:

# (1) Any alphabetic keys that arrive are always converted to their lower-case representations. This way, even if Caps Lock is active or a Shift key is held down, the character Archy receives is always lowercase.

# (2) Whenever a shift key is pressed or depressed, the key.globalState object sets its left_shift or right_shift property to UP or DOWN.

# (3) Any active QuasiMode can examine these properties of the globalState to determine whether it wants to make the character uppercase or not.    For instance, MainTextEntry now has code that detects whether one of the shift keys is pressed; if so, it inserts an uppercase version of the character entered.

# It should also be noted that the LED of the Caps Lock key will operate independently of Archy on some keyboards (the modified SDL.dll accesses the keyboard in exclusive mode which prevents the operating-system-wide caps lock state from being modified on many keyboards, but not all).   Eventually, we will try to find some kind of solution that allows Archy to restore the original OS-wide-state of the caps lock key when it is switched out to another application, so that when a user uses Caps Lock as their command quasimode key, they won't their caps lock mode activated, to their annoyance, when they switch applications.
