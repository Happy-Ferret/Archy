# Style Pool 
# Behavior list
# Cursor Location
# Selection Location
# Command History and Position in History
# Setting List


# The state information is saved in a gzip.GzipFile class. This compresses

# The following code provides functionality for saving the text content of Archy, in events where Archy crashes and the Humane Document becomes corrupt beyond repair.

# .  1) Whenever the user makes a change to their document (or just issues a command), a counter is incremented.
# .  2) Once this counter reaches MAX_CHANGES_PER_BACKUP, a backup file is saved.

# A backup file is named "_humane_text_<A>.txt", where "<A>" is a consecutively increasing integer.  Once TEXT_MAX_BACKUPS have been made, the oldest one is deleted, so that at most only TEXT_MAX_BACKUPS may exist at any given time.

# between two and three copies.  For strict safety, we should check for
# an existing .new file.  None such should exist if all has gone
# according to plan.  Specifically, if the disk fills up, the
# cPickle.dump will generate an exception.  Since we don't handle that
# exception right now, that will cause a partially-written .new file to
# exist.  If we find such a file, arguably, we should read as much of it
# in as we can.  On the other hand, what if those changes don't make
# sense without the rest of the file?  Better, instead, to handle a full
# disk better.
