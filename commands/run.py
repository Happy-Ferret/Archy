# Custom Importer Setup
# -----------------

# Previously, Archy used Python's imputil module to provide a custom hook for importing modules from the user's humane document.  However, imputil was a little inscrutable and complex in its usage and this area required a lot of documentation, because the imputil module itself was hardly documented at all.  It also hadn't been updated in years, which was puzzling.

# Major problems were encountered with the use of imputil once we tried distributing Archy with py2exe, due to the way that py2exe used ZIP files to import its own modules; put simply py2exe's import mechanism conflicted with imputil's.  After some research, the reason for imputil's recent dormancy and lack of documentation was discovered: a very simple and elegant framework was built-in to Python itself as of release 2.3.  This mechanism is documented quite thoroughly in the following document:

# http://python.fyxm.net/peps/pep-0302.html

# This mechanism is the one Archy currently uses, and it does not conflict with py2exe's import mechanism (most likely because py2exe uses the same mechanism).
