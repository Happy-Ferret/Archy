THE QUEST

Somewhere below, perhaps many Megabytes in the distance, is my address book.

I could leap to "ADDRESS BOOK", or I could leap to the alphabetical heads -- "A-" or "B-" or "C-" -- but why take a roundabout route when it's even easier to leap DIRECTLY to the name I'm looking for?

And if I don't remember the name exactly, then PART of it will do. Part of the phone number or address can also help me track down the information I need.

In short, thanks to Leap, any clue will do!

CHAPTER I - THE CALL

It was a dark and stormy night. The telephone rang. Tom lifted the receiver.

"Tell Marla we have to tell them," the soft, sultry voice said.

"Tell them...what?" said Tom.

"I thought you knew," said the voice. There was a click.

Tom hung up. Just then, lightning flashed outside and the radio snapped on. Glen Miller.

"It's going to be one of those nights," Tom said.

















`
CHAPTER XIII - THE SECOND CALL

It was another dark and stormy night. The phone rang.

"Hello," said Tom.

"It's Marla."

Tom was speechless. The silence could have filled the pool at the Beverly Hills Country Club in a second. But it was more -- it was several seconds.

"I gotta go," said Marla. There was a click.

Tom slowly lowered the receiver as the dial tone did its thing.

"That was...ambiguous," he explained.





















`
CHAPTER XIV

The day was tepid and unappetizing, like day-old miso soup.


















`
CHAPTER XV - THE MYSTERY DEEPENS

The high Sierras in winter. Tom crouched down in the snow. A squirrel sat opposite him. Their eyes met. The squirrel chattered something -- something nasty, Tom figured. "This could be...a mistake," Tom conjectured.





















`
CHAPTER XVI - THE BIG BREAK

Tom held his hand over his eyes and squinted. Nothing. He raised the binoculars. "Holy cow!" he said. "Now I see them!" The waves must have been forty feet high, breaking a mile out, and the surfers were as small as ants.

"Wait a minute," said Tom. "Wait just a minute! This isn't the kind of big break I was talking about." He clenched his fists. "You think you're pretty smart, don't you, Marla," he said.










`
CHAPTER XVII - WRITER'S BLOCK

Tom sat in the cafe. He ordered another cappuccino. Twelve cappuccino cups sat empty on the table before him.






`
CHAPTER XVIII - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

It was a dark....









`
CHAPTER XIX - MARLA CALLS

"Hello, Tom?"

"Yeah?"

"This is Marla."

"Where are you?"

"I'm down at the docks. Get here soon, or ..."
















`
CHAPTER XX - MARLA MISSING

"Or what?" said Tom.

But there was no answer.

































`
CHAPTER XXI - THE DOCKS

It was a sunny day, sunny and warm, with clouds hanging in the sky like crumpled paper napkins. It gets like that in southern California.

Tom was thinking, thinking about how a lot of people -- smart people, good people -- misspell "southern California" with a capital 'S', when he pulled up to the harbor.

There was a boat tied up at the dock, a big boat. Tom squinted. "Marla's Mystery" it said on the side in day-glo green letters two feet high. "Could be a trap," Tom thought as he got out of the car.

A leggy redhead was sponging the mast, suds flying everywhere.

"Marla?" Tom inquired.

"You mean my SISTER -- wise guy?" the redhead said, turning around. He had a voice two octaves lower than a bassoon and a chiseled jaw that could've cracked walnuts.

"I don't have any walnuts," said Tom.

"Huh?" the guy said.
